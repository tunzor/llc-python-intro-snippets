## Example Python code snippets

### A collection of example code snippets for the Ladies Learning Code intro to python workshop

These can be run in the terminal with `python [PROGRAM_NAME]` for example `python show-cursor-position.py`

#### These use the pyautogui library

`show-cursor-position.py`

This will endlessly print the position of the cursor to the command line. Stop it by pressing control+c.

`chrome-python-uses.py`

This will move the cursor to a specific point on the screen (the chrome icon on the launcher bar at the bottom), click the left mouse button, press the key combo COMMAND+T to open a new tab in chrome, type "What can I use python for?", and hit enter.
The `chromeX` and `chromeY` variables should be changed to correspond to the location on your computer.
